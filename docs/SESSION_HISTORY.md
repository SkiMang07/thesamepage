## Session 4 — 2026-07-17

**Goal:** Implement real AI-assisted 1:1 prep — the core product IP.

**What was done:**
- Rewrote `_build_prep_prompt()` in `backend/routes/one_on_ones.py` with real
  management frameworks: commitment accountability, SBI feedback scaffolding,
  GROW coaching for obstacles, situational signal logic, and a mandatory closing
  question.
- Updated `PrepResponse` Pydantic model: replaced flat `prep_questions` /
  `talking_points` lists with `situation_summary` (str) + `agenda_items`
  (list of `AgendaItem` with `title`, `rationale`, `suggested_questions`).
- Added `AgendaItem` Pydantic model.
- Updated the `/prep` route to query recent 1:1 history (last 3 summaries) and
  compute `days_since_last` — both fed into the prompt for context.
- Prompt now uses `AI_DEFAULT_MODEL_HEAVY` explicitly with `max_tokens=2000`.
- Fixed `log_one_on_one` to include `source_type`/`source_id` on commitment
  inserts (aligns with the polymorphic commitments schema from Session 3).

**Decisions locked:**
- Prep output shape: `situation_summary` + `agenda_items[]` (not flat Q&A lists).
  Frontend should render each item as a collapsible card with title, rationale,
  and questions.
- Closing question is mandatory — always the last agenda item.
- Commitment review is always the first agenda item when commitments exist.
- `max_tokens=2000` for prep (up from default 1500) to give room for 3–5
  structured items.

**Next step (completed in same session — see below):**
Wire the `/prep` endpoint to the frontend. Done.

## Session 4b — 2026-07-21

**Goal:** Wire the 1:1 prep backend to the frontend.

**What was done:**
- Added `GET /{report_id}` endpoint to `backend/routes/direct_reports.py` (was missing).
- Updated `frontend/lib/api.ts`:
  - Added TypeScript types: `DirectReport`, `OneOnOne`, `Commitment`, `AgendaItem`, `PrepResponse`.
  - Added `getDirectReport(id)` and `getOneOnOneHistory(directReportId)` functions.
  - Typed return values on all existing functions.
- Created `frontend/app/app/reports/[id]/page.tsx` — DR detail page showing name,
  role, notes, and full 1:1 history list. "Start 1:1 prep →" button links to prep page.
- Created `frontend/app/app/reports/[id]/prep/page.tsx` — 3-step prep flow:
  - Step 1: freeform notes input + "Generate prep sheet" button
  - Step 2: `situation_summary` (blue card), open commitments reminder (amber card if any),
    and collapsible `agenda_items` cards (first open by default)
  - Step 3: log the meeting (summary textarea + new commitments one-per-line → parsed into
    individual commitment rows on save), redirects to DR detail on success.

**Decisions locked:**
- Agenda items render as collapsible cards with rationale as italic subtext and
  suggested questions as indented list. First card open by default.
- New commitments on log step are split by newline — simplest UX, avoids a
  dynamic "add another" form that adds complexity.
- On successful log, redirect to DR detail page (not dashboard) so history is visible.

**Next step (completed in same session — see below):**
Backend deployed to Railway. Frontend Vercel deploy is next.

## Session 4c — 2026-07-21

**Goal:** Wire Supabase Auth so the full flow is end-to-end testable.

**What was done:**
- Created `frontend/app/auth/callback/route.ts` — server route handler that
  exchanges the Supabase magic link `code` param for a session cookie and
  redirects to `/app/dashboard`. Without this, clicking a magic link 404s.
- Created `frontend/middleware.ts` — Next.js middleware that:
  - Runs on all `/app/*` routes
  - Calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` on every request to refresh stale tokens
  - Redirects unauthenticated users hitting protected routes to `/app/login`
  - Redirects authenticated users hitting `/app/login` to `/app/dashboard`
- Updated `frontend/app/app/login/page.tsx`:
  - Added `emailRedirectTo: ${origin}/auth/callback` to the `signInWithOtp` call
    (required — without it Supabase uses the site URL root, which doesn't handle
    the code exchange)
  - Added loading state + error handling on the auth call
  - Reads `?error=auth_failed` query param from failed callback redirects and
    shows a friendly message
  - "Use a different email" link resets the form after a send

**Decisions locked:**
- Magic link only (no password). Revisit if conversion data says otherwise.
- `/auth/callback` is the canonical redirect URL — must be added to the
  Supabase project's "Redirect URLs" allow-list (Auth → URL Configuration).
  Add both `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` (dev) and the Vercel prod URL.

**Next step (completed in same session — see below):**
Backend deployed to Railway. Frontend Vercel deploy is next.

## Session 4d — 2026-07-21

**Goal:** Get Supabase running and backend deployed to Railway.

**What was done:**
- Fixed `database/schema.sql` — forward reference error (organizations policy
  referenced users before it was created). Restructured to tables-first,
  policies-last. Schema now runs clean in Supabase.
- Additional schema fixes: renamed `full_name` → `name` on direct_reports,
  added `summary` column to one_on_ones, made `org_id` nullable on core tables,
  made `commitments.title` nullable, added `handle_new_user()` trigger to
  auto-create public.users row on auth signup.
- Fixed backend column name mismatches: `user_id` → `manager_id` in
  direct_reports.py and one_on_ones.py; `user_id` → `owner_id` in commitments
  insert.
- Initialized git repo, pushed to github.com/SkiMang07/thesamepage.
- Created `backend/Procfile` (`web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`).
- Added `backend/.python-version` pinned to 3.11 (pydantic-core build failed
  on Railway without it).
- Backend deployed successfully to Railway.

**Decisions locked:**
- Use Supabase legacy API keys (`eyJ...` format) — new `sb_publishable_` format
  not confirmed compatible with SDK versions in requirements.txt.
- Python 3.11 pinned via `.python-version` for Railway builds.
- `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway set to placeholder — must be updated to real Vercel
  domain after frontend deploy, then Railway redeployed.

**Next step:**
Deploy frontend to Vercel:
1. vercel.com → New Project → import SkiMang07/thesamepage → root dir: `frontend`
2. Env vars: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (legacy),
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL (Railway domain)
3. After deploy: update FRONTEND_URL in Railway to real Vercel domain → redeploy.
4. Add `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback` to Supabase Auth → URL
   Configuration → Redirect URLs.

## Session 3 — 2026-07-17

**Goal:** High-fidelity mockup of all 5 core screens + full schema architecture
aligned with the Miro board.

**What was done:**
- Created `mockup.html` — self-contained interactive HTML mockup with Tailwind
  CDN covering all 5 screens: Marketing Home, Manager Dashboard, Direct Report
  Detail (Priya Patel), 1:1 Prep (3-step flow), and Commitment Tracker.
- Reviewed the Miro board (`https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNh7GuDE=/`) directly.
- Rewrote `database/schema.sql` from 4 tables to 28 tables to fully reflect the
  Miro board's data model.
- Answered all pre-build architecture questions (hierarchy, privacy, goals, etc.)

**Decisions locked:**
- Schema expanded from 4 → 28 tables. See ENGINEERING.md for full table list.
- Hierarchy: `users.manager_id` self-ref. Director/VP sees everything except
  1:1 notes. 1:1 notes are private to the writing manager only.
- `manager_report_connections` join table is explicit (was on the Miro board) —
  not inferred from the users tree.
- Role levels (`role_levels` table) are the central connecting concept for
  metrics, skills, and values configs.
- Metric/Skill/Value configs follow identical pattern: a config table + a
  `_scale_definitions` companion table with evaluation points 1–4 (quantitative
  output, qualitative output, optional numeric range).
- Goals: `parent_goal_id` self-ref; levels are company/department/team/individual.
- Commitments: polymorphic `source_type` + `source_id` (one_on_one/goal/
  project/manual).
- Assessment levels: stable ordinal (1–5) + configurable label per org.
- Development plans: separate tables for aspirations, opportunities
  (skills/knowledge), training (with projected cost), and manager notes.
- IC login: infrastructure is in schema (`user_id` nullable on `direct_reports`),
  but not built for MVP.
- Stripe is still NOT next.

**Next step:**
Begin backend implementation on top of the new schema. First priority is
`_build_prep_prompt()` in `backend/routes/one_on_ones.py` — the AI-assisted
1:1 prep endpoint. The prompt should incorporate real management frameworks
(commitment review, situational question logic, feedback scaffolding), not
generic questions. Confirm with Andrew before starting in case priorities shifted.

## Session 2 — 2026-07-17

**Goal:** Reset from scaffold confusion, confirm tech stack, establish
documentation strategy.

**What was done:**
- Clarified project identity: "The Same Page" = the new management tool.
  A separate agent-builder project with the same name will eventually be
  renamed. No code changes needed now.
- Confirmed the July 14 scaffold is valid and in the right folder
  (`/01 Projects/The Same Page/`).
- Restructured documentation system:
  - `CLAUDE.md` → short TOC/index (read first, routes to other docs)
  - `docs/ENGINEERING.md` → stack, conventions, auth, AI call patterns, scope rules
  - `docs/GTM.md` → pricing, ICP, growth strategy, content plan, competitive landscape
  - `docs/DESIGN.md` → design framework, principles, decisions log
  - `docs/SESSION_HISTORY.md` → this file

**Decisions locked:**
- Tech stack confirmed: FastAPI + Supabase backend (Railway), Next.js frontend
  (Vercel), Tailwind CSS, Anthropic Claude via `ai_core.py`.
- Documentation structure above is the canonical system going forward.
  New decisions belong in the relevant doc, not in CLAUDE.md directly.
- Stripe is explicitly NOT next — it's premature until there's a working product.

**Next step (superseded by Session 3):**
Build the first real feature: AI-assisted 1:1 prep (`_build_prep_prompt()`).
See Session 3 for current state.

## Session 1 — 2026-07-14

**Goal:** Build project scaffold.

**What was done:**
- Created full project folder structure (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `database/`)
- Implemented FastAPI backend with `main.py`, `config.py`, `utils.py`, `ai_core.py`
- Implemented routes: `direct_reports.py` (full CRUD), `one_on_ones.py` (list,
  create, AI-assisted prep endpoint stubbed)
- Created `database/schema.sql` with 4 tables and RLS policies
- Created Next.js frontend with App Router, `(marketing)/` pages (home, pricing,
  blog), `app/` pages (login, dashboard), `lib/api.ts`, `lib/supabase.ts`
- Wrote `CLAUDE.md` (engineering reference) and `PRODUCT_VISION.md` (full vision
  pulled from Andrew's Miro board)

**Decisions locked:**
- Stack: FastAPI + Supabase + Next.js (see ENGINEERING.md for rationale)
- 4-table schema: direct_reports, one_on_ones, commitments, subscriptions
- `get_authenticated_client()` pattern for all protected routes
- All AI calls through `ai_core.py`

**Next step (at time):** Fill out `_build_prep_prompt()` with real frameworks
OR wire Stripe. (Resolved in Session 2 — 1:1 prep content is next.)
